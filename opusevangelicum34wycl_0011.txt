INTRODUCTION. VII

of the school of Antichrist, its excommunications and tyrannical censures;
in De Apostasia and the Trialogus (1383) the Pope is identified with
Antichrist; also in short tracts that date from the last years of Wyclif's
life.¹ Thus it is no matter for surprise that De Antichristo should have
been written; it should rather surprise us that he did not give this title
to one of his earlier works; for instance, to De Potestate Papae,· for
we find therein sentences that are almost word for word the same as
others in De Antichristo. The Pope, to deserve his title, should imi-
tate Christ in life and doctrine; as he does just the reverse, he is Anti-
christ.2 All that is written of him is quite applicable to the Pope. Christ
is truth, the Pope a lie; Christ is poor, the pope is rich3 Christ is
meek and gentle, the Pope proud, revengeful and cruel. And soon.
When, in Ch. VIII, he deals with the problem: Is the Pope necessary
to the Church? it is quite clear from Ch. XI that the whole tractate
exists only sor the sake of answering the following question: What the
character of a truePope is, and what the character of a modern Pope.
Such passages are often to be met with in Wyclif’s latest works. But
w'e shall give no more quotations from them, and will now turn to the
book which has come down to us with the title De Antichristo.

a) De Christo et suo adversario Antichristo.

In this tract, our author’s doctrine of Christ and His adversary Anti-
christ is set forth as succinctly as possible.3 There is but one Church,

remark: Dicentibus se hodie papas 4 Et comperto quod pastores isti spohistici
