XXIV INTRODUCTION.

as either totally rejected the Gospel«, or understood it falsely. Such being
the case to-day‚ we may easily judge how much the present Church
has deviated from that of early times.¹ In his exposition of the parable
of the Ten Virgins‚ Wyclif points out how foolish it is of monks to rise
at midnight, a practice which has no foundation but a single word of
the Psalmist3 it would be preferable for them to regulate their life better.
Those who sell oil⁷ are the begging friars and other sects, who sell their
prayers and letters of brotherhood3 but their oil will give no light at
the Day of Judgment.2 Then each one will have to answer for himself
with his own merits and demerits; then the pomp of Antichrist will come
to nothing, and his Vicariate will be at an end.3

In his incomplete work on Antichrist‚ Wyclif often alludes to the
worldliness of the Church‚ and also speaks in many places of the Lord's
Suppes, “the farewell of Christ”. The Reformer’s own last efforts, and
his farewell to his disciples, are directed to the destruction of all traditions‚
such, for instance, as confession, to which subject he again and again
returns. His last labours were on St. John⁷s Gospel, XIII, 27——31‚ on which
he comments‚ and quotes the exposition given by St. Augustin. It is at the
passage where Judas‚ having heard Christ’s order, “What thou doest‚ do
quickly‚³³ goes out, that his own work abruptly comes to an end; it
marks the close of the activity of this celebrated reformer, who did not
attain the reputation of a Luther‚ merely because he lived not at the
end, but at the beginning of the Humanistic movement. But who can now
deny that his plan of reform was wider, and based upon a more solid
foundanon thanthat ofIAnher?

The Opus Evangelicum, but especially that part of it called De
Antichristo, caused a great sensation among both friends and foeS. In a
letter of the University of Oxford to the Archbishop of Canterbury and
his suffragans (1412) in which 267 heretical propositions of our author
are condemned‚4 the first 72 are extracted from this work, as is noted
