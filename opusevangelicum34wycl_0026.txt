XXII INTRODUCTION.

if the Popes do not answer satisfactorily on these points, they should
both be shunned as heretics.¹

From this we may draw practical conclusions as to our duties for
the present.2 No nation is obliged to transact business with either of
the Popes’ courts at its own expense. No clerk should be admitted into
England by order of a Pope, until the latter has spoken ont and justified
his saith. The higher clergy would be judges of this, and the poor
priests would have only to set forth what the true saith is, and then to
seek the greater welfare of their country. The secular rulers’ duty is
to put down all abuses in the Church, and the duty of priests is to
point them out to the secular rulers. Who would kiss the feet of a declared
heretic? ³

Wyclif and his friends took measures to win temporal and spiri-
tual lords to his views. “They applied to the Pope, to the Bishop of
Lincoln and to certain secular lords, asking for an enquiry into the
rectitude of their belief, to the end that it might be put down, if heretical‚
but if Catholic‚ upheld and respected.4 Wyclif says in praise of his
doctrine that his adversaries can make no answer to it, and dare not
attempt to reply, when his companions preach it to the people. Yet he
would never think of accusing his opponents of heresy, and prefers to
gain them over by instructing them.5 God's word gives peace to the
faithful; the Pope's word, to our adversaries.” If it be said that Christ
must needs give His aid to the right Pope, we may answer: How can
God act with a prelate given to things of this world?6 His very prayer
becomes a sin. If the prayer of a righteous man, praying for a sinner‚
is not heard, how can God be forced to hearken to one living in
open sin?

“Then let him who is in Judea ssee to the mountains.³’ The
members of the Church are priests, laymen, and servants. Of these, the
