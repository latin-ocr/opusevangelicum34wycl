the rulers of the Church in stern and heartfelt language, and that he
died with the same language on his lips. In hundreds of passages he asserts
and maintains that the body then called the Church was no church at
all: it was grievously burdened with the superfluities of tradition; it was
in open contradiction with Jesus Christ's spirit and doctrine; it required
a thorough reform, and a return to the practices of the primitive Church.
The contrast between the Church of the Apostles and the Ecclesia
moderna appears nowhere so powerfully as in the Opus Evangelicum.
It is in the form of a lively trialogus‚ Wyclif using for the first two
books the commentaries of Chrysostom and Augustin, those of Chry-
sostom and Jerome for the following books. His copyists understood it

Holy Ghost.

In the Opus Evangelicum, the attacks against the hierarchy are

occasion to write more at length a little further.

a practical consequence, the Pope, the Bishops, the Imperial Prelates,
and all those that wield any power in the Church, ought to imitate
Jesus Christ, beginning with him who is first of all. But ever since

in the place of Jesus Christ3 but let him know that such blasphemy
ought to be kept down by his weakness.’' Christ said, Blessed are the
poor;3 let the Pope see how these words suit him. We know, according
to Robert Grosseteste, the eight marks of humility which every Christian
should possess; the Pope has not a single one of them. And Wyclif
