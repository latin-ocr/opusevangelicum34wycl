INTRODUCTION. XV

why church dignities are to be got for money. Provided the Pope finds
he can profit by any ecclesiastical function‚ does he care who discharges
it?¹ And yet priests who do not fulfil the duties to which their office
obliges them have no claim to tithes. But who would dare publicly to
speak against such irregularities? His fate would soon be that of John
the Baptist, when he reproved Herod for his evil life.2

“Woe unto you who make clean the outside of the cup and platter,
and within are full of unrighteousness and uncleanness.’' The text suits
our present clergy, who care more for externals and things belonging
to their particular Order than for God’s law; they resemble whited se-
pulchres, that look fair from outside, but within are filled with dead
men's bones. They build tombs to the prophets‚ and monuments over the
graves of the righteous; but they act like those priests of the Old Cove-
nant, who were guilty of the prophets' blood. Are not the “poor priests'³
who do but imit-ate Christ in word and deed‚ persecuted in England
even now?

At the 26⁸¹ chapter, Wyclif begins to comment on Matth. XXIV.
The disciples of Christ were showing Him the Temple and its various
buildings. But He said: “Verily, not one stone shall remain upon another.'³
And the destruction of the Temple shows us that Antichrist's church will
also be destroyed.⁴¹

“Many will come in my name, saying: Ι am Christ, and they will
mislead many.'' Here Wyclif uses the commentary of St. Jerome. This
Saint‚ he says, knew history well and Scripture still better; and he
thought that Antichrist is that man, and that man alone, who sets him-
self in Christ’s place. And this points to the Pope, whom twelve distinct
characteristics show to be Christ's adversary.5 He pretends to be Christ's
Vicar upon earth, and seizes every occasion to lead the Church astray.
