VIII INTRODUCTION.

outside of which there is no salvation. It includes the Church triumphant,
militant, and suffering3 saints in Heaven, men on earth, and souls in
purgatory. Each part of this one Church has a separate unity in itself.
This unity is destroyed by the Four Orders, who have brought the
devil into the Church. Was St. Peter its Head? No: only Christ was,
and is, that. All His disciples have the same power. It is blasphemy
to say that the Popes are the heads of the Church militant3 some of
them were notoriously devils; and as to making thern the heads of the
Church triumphant, we might as well assert that they rule over the
angels. The power which the Popes posseSS, given to them by the Em-
perors, has no foundation in Holy Writ. The miserable condition of the
Church, the schism, the deplorable state of the clergy‚ the wordliness
of the Papacy, the Papal elections, in open contradiction with the rules
given in Scripture‚ all prove that the Church might exist without the
Pope. As it would be advantageous to the Church if the Pope followed
Christ both in life and doctrine, so it is hurtful to it to have a Pope
who from both these standpoints is their opposite, and therefore Anti-
christ. Jesus Christ stands out in opposition to them as the true Shep-
herd of our souls.¹ The Church can exist perfectly well without a Pope,
as was the case from the time of Christ's ascension to that of the en-
dowment of the Church. This papal presumption has caused the Church
to decrease in number, and doctrines of devils to be introduced therein.
It is at present a dogma that no Pope can possibly err, either in life
or doctrine, for it is held as a rule of saith that all he decides is to
be believed. Thence we find all those numberless privileges, indulgences,
and excommunications‚ respected under pain of damnation; whereas,
every pope is fallible, and some were men of sinful lives. How can
an adversary os Christ be the Head of the Church?

He is contrary to Christ in twelve points. Christ is the truth‚ the
Pope bases his power on a lie. His words, his writings and his life are
all a lie3 sor, calling himself the Vicar of Christ, his life is in absolute
contradiction to Him. In his writings, bulls and Decretals‚ he craves
for mundane glory‚ whilst the Gospel bids us to renounce it. Christ
