XXX INTRODUCTION.

3. The transmission of the MS& their ἀεῖ-,α and
concluding remarRs.

Both the MSS. (Cam. Β. 16. 2 [A]‚ and Dubl. C. Ι. 23) which
contain the tractate De Antichristo have already been fully described in
Sermones I. p. XXXV, De Ecclesia pp. XXII—XXIV, and op. Ev. I, p. V.
In the first volume of the Sermones is given a passage in the hand-
writing of A, and also one in that of Β. As to Nos. 43 and 44 of Shir-
ley’s catalogue, Ι will mention that both these tracts are to be found in the
Prague MSS. N. H. 7. Some future editor may profit by this remark.

Ihoped to succeed in finding hitherto unknown historical data
concerning the conssict of Wyclif with the Papacy between 1378 and
1384. There are many allusions in Wyclif's works which seem to show
that the Pope's efforts were not limited solely to the five bulls promul-
gated against him by Gregory XI, on May the 22¹¹d 1377, from Santa Maria
Maggiore; and in one of Wyclif’s writings, I have, Ι believe, discovered that·
he complains ofhaving been unjustly treated by the Pope.¹'I‘he whole affair is
somewhat obscure, and is not cleared up by any of his subsequent works. It
has reference to an event in his life concerning which we have no other
data. According to him, the Pope had deprived him of a benefice in
Lincoln, to give it to a young foreigner. This fact, however, can by no
means be assigned as the reason of the passionate bitterness from which he
never can refrain when speaking of Pope Gregory; nor do the contents
of those bulls I have mentioned suffice to account for his animosity. I
accordingly travelled to Rome, to find out the cause of his hatred in the
archives of the Vatican, now so liberally thrown open to the public. But
though I received the most friendly assistance that Ι could expect from
Director Denisse, all my investigations on that point proved fruitless, The
bulls of Pope John XXIII of February the 22¹¹d, in which he forbids
Wyclif's books to be read and commands them to be burnt,2 are the
only documents which have been preserved, or rather which I was
able to find about Wyclif in the Vatican archives. Neither in the index to
