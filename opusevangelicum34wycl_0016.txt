in virtue and religion he goes beyond Christ Himself.¹

“They love the first places in feasts‚ and in the schools, and to
be saluted in the ma1⁴ket-place.³> The Pope blasphemously commands all
to call him “Holy Father³³, whilst his rule should be, that he alone is
the highest who is the humblest. By this pride of the clergy,= the Church
comes to grief. The Pope even declares that he stands in Christ's stead
on earth3 a falsehood which harms the Church more than anything
else.2 He is so hardened in his pride, that were Christ to return to
earth as a man, he would not suffer him to sit by his side.3

“Woe unto yon, Scribes and Pharisees! who close the kingdom
of Heaven against man.³³ This is done by the Pope and his fellows, the
Scribes and Pharisees of our days. They themselves cannot enter the
kingdom of Heaven; and so they will suffer no one else to enter. It is
a blessing and 3 comfort to mankind that God has shortened the
time of Antichrist’s reign, and diminished his power. His power is divi-

and by the 1311 1116 mendicant Orders.5 By their laws, they block up
the entrance to Heaven, >and will not allow the word of God to be
preached. They hold it a crime to translate the Bible into English. No
one who has studied theology is promoted by them,6 and they perse-
cute whoever teaches the true meaning of Scripture:7 Yet more: it is
taught in their schools that the Bible is radically false.8 He that keeps
Christ's law is considered a heretic by the 1311 of that Antichristian
head, and is tormented with annoyances and vexatious lawsuits.9 The
