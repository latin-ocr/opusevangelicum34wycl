VI INTRODUCTION.

The word Antichrist has sor Wyclif a very wide signification.
According to him, every man whose teaching and whose manner of
living are contrary to Jesus Christ, is Antichrist. The Pope — that is,
not one Pope in particular, but the Papacy in general —- has laboured under
this opposition to Christ, ever since it became Caesarian and worldly by
its secular possessions and temporal power. How little Millenarian ideas
and tendencies inssuenced our author may be seen by the fact that,
though he admits that Antichrist has reigned ever since Constantine and
Pope Sylvester‚ he does not think that the end of the world is near,
but believes this state of things to be transient, a passing stage in the
development of the Church, which, as it existed centuries before Anti-
christ, will also outlive him in the future. Still I will not deny that the
Western Schism made a considerable impression upon Wyclif. It is even
demonstrated that he began to disseminate and to establish his doctrine
concerning Antichrist after 1378, till he set it forth fully developed
in the present work, afterwards in the unsparing language of his tract
“De Christo et suo adversario Antichristo,” and lastly‚ though not at
great length, in his exposition of the Gospel of St. MattheW.

There are some allusions to this doctrine in his work, De Ecclesia
(1378).¹ In De Officio Regis (1379), he calls the Pope a pseudo-Christ,
unnecessary for the government of the Church.2 In his Dialogus (1379)
and previously in his De Officio Pastorali (1378) he inveighs against
censures, indulgences‚ and bulis of Antichrist.3 In the Dialogus, he
says: “Why should the fall of the Papacy be lamented? this institution
only breeds continual quarrels and conflicts concerning secular power.
It is not even named in the Bible; so it is evidently an invention of
Imperial policy in the time of Antichrist.³³ And in his Sermones he
identifies the Papacy with Antichrist.4 In De Eucharistia‚ he calls
papal law the law of Antichrist.5 In De Blasphemia (1381), he speaks
