INTRODUCTION. XXIX

Protestationes which John Hus, Jacob of MieS, Simon of Tisnow, Prokop
of Pilsen, Zdislaus of Zwierzeticz, and John of Giezin publicly made in
their famous defence of Wyclif's works, on July the 27ffi, 28¹²¹¹‚ 29⁸³ and
31th, and August the 6th 1410, in presence of the numerous professors
and students of the University. The first of them says: In primis protestor
quod nec iam nec in posterum intendo aliquid pertinaciter dicere vel
defendere contra Dei legem ἃς.

The second runs thus: Ne ergo ex defectu mee protestacionis in
me aliquam accipiant scandali occasionem, publice protestor quod in
nullo meo actu preterito, presenti, ac futuro, intendebam nec intendo
pertinaciter exanimo aliquid aperire et defendere quod est contra fidem . . ,

All the other declarations are similar to these. ¹ The above-mentioned
defenders of Wyclif gave lectures, copies of which were afterwards pu-
blicly distributed, and called Opera Magistralia. It was essential that
such publications should not be without a declaration of the sort; and
the presence of such a declaration in Shirley’s Νο 44 proves it to be
the opus magistrale referred to; whereas, No 43 being without any such
declaration, we are justified in setting it aside as a mere excerpt from
De Antichristo I, ch. III and seq.

In Shirley’s N0 44 the Protestatio is as follows: Omnia autem prius ·
exposita sunt tamquam dicta probabiliter capienda, protestando quod si
aliqua persona ecclesie docuerit sensum magis probabilem, volumus illi
humiliter consentire . . .

Wyclif's declarations of faith, terse and to the point, were very
popular; they were subsequently collected and edited together.2 We must
however, remark that their value is merely that which belongs to a for-
mality3 they give no proof either for or against Wyclif’s orthodoxy, and
it would be mere folly to draw thence any inferences as to our author’s
character.

It is regrettable that, misled by Shirley’s notice, Ι did not take
this tract in hand at an earlier date. It is not advisable to prepare it
for press now, at the eleventh bour, for that would retard the publi-

cation of the present work for a whole year. We shall have to publish
it amongst the Miscellanea.
