INTRODUCTION.

1 Antichrist in Wyclif’s previous works.

The treatise which lies before us was never completed. In the
Preface to the Opus Evangelicum, Wyclif says that three considerable
groups of passages in Scripture, namely Matth. V—VII, XXIII—XXV,

, and John XV—XVII, especially deserve to be carefully explained, over

and above the literal sense and the usual exposition. In the first and
'second book he explains Matth. V—VII, in the third, Matth. XXIII—XXV.
·The fourth was to contain an explanation of John XV--XVH3 but he
did not even complete that of ch. XV. Only about one fifth of what he
intended was done when his life was brought to a close.

space of time between 1378 and 1384, produced such a quantity> of
abstruse and powerful writings, so many tractates, opuscules, short tracts,
and sermons, came to an end with this work. None of his contempo-
raries, so far as we know, can be compared to him in literary fecun-
dity. Moreover, the logical sequence of his system, gradually developed
as he wrote, justly excites our wonder; and this is a point on which
I lay streSS‚ because many passages in which he attempts to prove that
he is an obedient son of the Church have been contrasted with the
violence of his attacks upon Church government, in order to cast obloquy
upon his character, and to raise a suspicion of duplicity and equivocation.
But any one who peruses Wyclif's works in chronological order will
soon sind that there is nothing equivocal in them; that he pursued his
course without either hesitancy or deviation; that he all along addressed
