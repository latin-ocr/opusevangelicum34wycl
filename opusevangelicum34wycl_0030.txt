XXVI lNTRODUCTION.

as a translation from the English tractate, I should at least have had
N0 44printed together with the present work; for Νο 44 is, as I find,
the above mentioned “opus magistrale'³. As to N0 43, which is by no
II. cap. XIII, but
from De Antichristo, Ι, cap. HI, it is very doubtful whether Wyclif
made the selection himself, and therefore whether it is to be numbered

means extracted from De Sermone Domini in Monte,

amongst his works. Shirley is indeed right to call it an extract, but it
is from De Antichristo,

No 44 is quite another affair. The work ought rather to have come
under the heading Traeis, than under that of Se'rmons, Expositions &c,
Its contents indeed are just the same as in the larger treatises which
followed it; but its importance is considerable, both because it served
as a sketch, or rough draft, for the others, and because it shows us how
Wyclif used to sow his fierce invectives against the Papal power and
Antichristianism broadcast amongst the people. Nor can we deny that
the treatment of the subject-matter is in the shorter tract far keener,
more powerful, and more to the point. It is a great advantage that no
quotations from Augustine, Jerome‚ and Chrysostom are there tointerrupt
the text. Wyclif is here a good deal more positive, more downright; for
instance: Si quis dixerit vobis, Ecce hic Avenione est Christus domini,
qui se nominat papam Clementem, aut illic Rome, qui se nominat papam
Urbanum: Nolite credere. Compare this with a much weaker passage,
given further on.

That this strong tract is the “Opus magistrale fidelis doctoris”, so

which Wyclif refers, is proved by a comparison of both texts.

Sup. 24t⁰m cap. Matth. Cap. III:

Cum videritis abhominacionem . . .
Licet autem iste textus evangelii ab
diaboli sit

tamen indubitanter eius

usu ecclesie ex cautela
sublatus,
sensus a fidelibus est notandus. Cum
Christus summe sapiens et summe
benivolus sue ecclesie ipsi mandat:
Qui legit, intelligat. Ex quo videtur

quod Christus innuit huius evangelii

Licet autem textus iste evangelii ab
usu ecclesie ex cautela diaboli sit

Christus summe sapiens et summe
