XX INTRODUCTION.

ὁ. Christ taught that the Gospel should be preached to all freely;
the Pope says, in his bulls (which have no Scripture warrant) that the
people are to hear only what he chooses.

7. Christ instructs us to shun earthly honour and lucre; the Pope
orders us to do the reverse.

8. Christ was ever true and faithful in His promises; the Pope,
in his, has no end but lying and deceit.

All this necessarily proves that the Pope is Antichrist.¹ Christ
taught His Church only things useful, needful, and according to reason3
the Pope teaches many things false, unnecessary, and without any rea-
sonable foundation. It is only ironically that he may be called “Holy
Father³’; the holy place where he dwells is a nest of diabolical simony,
full of lies and deceit.2 Other signs by which Antichrist will be known,
are mentioned in the Bible; they all suit the Pope. By giving privileges
which imply a falsehood, and therefore could not be granted even by
God, he exalts himself above God. He sets himself up as the highest
judge in earthly matters, whereas Christ said: “O man, who made me
a judge amongst you?’³ He makes laws which contradict the laws of God3
he seeks his own fame and profit. What else is aimed at by his unjust
claims to crown the Emperor, to bestow bishoprics and other dignities,
and to grant privileges and indulgences?3 No Pope, no Christian, is to
be obeyed, except in so far as his commands are identical with those
of Christ. Therefore examine the spirit of their laws, whether or no it
proceeds from God3 if not, let Bishop, Cardinal or Pope command, he
should not be obeyed.4 Such a rule would soon deliver us from Anti-
christ's follies, his indulgences and absolutioris. We are ready to obey,
but only if it be proved that the Pope acts according to Christ's orders.5

¹ Quare ergo non foret talis capitaliter Antichristus? 2 Talis refuga . . .
non facit aliquem locum sanctum, sed sicut ipse facit se nominari patrem beatis—
simum, sic facit curiam suam specialem nidum diaboli simonie . . . 3pp. 135,
136J7. Coronando cesarem, conferendo episcopatus et alias dignitates, concedendo
privilegia ct alias indulgencias que nescit si consonant beneficio Dei patris, videtur
ad gloriam mundanam et lucrum proprium aspirare. ⁴ Temptate ergo spiritus
si ex Deo sunt, et non amplius facite quod papa, cardinalis, episcopus, prelatus,
rector vel sacerdos iusserit faciendum. 5 Docto tamen quod papa in hoc sequitur
Dominum Jesum Christum parati sumus . . . suis monitis consentire.. .
