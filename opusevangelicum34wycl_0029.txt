INTRODUCTION. XXV

in the concluding remark: Expliciunt hereses et errores Johannis‚ ab·
stracti de libro suo intitulato “De Sermone Domini in Monte'³. Et con-
tinet liber iste quatuor libros particulares, quorum tertius est “De An-
tichristo’', i. e. de papa secundum glossam.

c) Os Wyclifs shorter commentaries on St. Mattlz. XXIII and XXIV.

In De Antichristo, Book I, ch. 36„ Wyclif complains that, though
former commentators have given themselves much trouble about the
meaning of the passage, “Qui legit etc.³’, in St. Matthew's Gospel, none
of them has found it; and this is the more to be regretted, because
the right interpretation of 3 prophecy is worth as much as the prophecy
itself. They are excusable‚ however. Before a conflagrafflon, there appear
many signs which indicate it; first a light, then a thick smoke, and So
on: so it is with the abomination of desolation; certain of the Saints have
recognized some of its signs, but not all, for they only gradually become
manifest. Wyclif then quotes an author whom he follows: “Unde sic
legimus in opere quodam magistrali . . ,³³3 and a little further: “Ideo cum
protestacione premissa dicit predictus fidelis tamquam sibi probabile.. ‚³³

And in the next chapter: “Addit eciam idem doctor pro exposicione
ulteriori huius textus evangelici quod dictum evangelium utitur isto termino
cLocus sanctus’, pocius pro falsa ficticia quam pro veritate rei...²³

Whoever is acquainted with the style of Mediaeval writers will at
once guess that the “quoddam opus³³ is one of Wyclif⁷s works, and that
by “predictus fidelis²³, and e‘idem doctor’', he means himself. But it is
not easy to find out to which “opus magistrale’' Wyclif alludeS. I think
I have discovered which it is.

Shirley, in his valuable Catalogue of Wyclif’s works, under the
heading, sermons, Expositions and practical theology, notices Νο 43 as:
Expositio S. Matth. cap. XXIII, sive de Vae octuplici, and says: Extracted
from De Sermone Domini in Monte, II, cap. XIII. Also ΝΟ 443 Expositio
S. Matth. CXXIV, sive de Antichristo. “Apparently a translation from the
English tract on the same chapter.³'

Both of these notices are wrong, and the second has led me into
3 blunder that I must mention, though unfortunately too late to correct
it. Had I not unquestioningly followed Shirley’s statement, considering
Νο 43 to be an extract from the larger work De Antichristo, and N0 44
