XVI INTRODUCTION.

There can, therefore, be no doubt that the Pope is the Antichrist men-
tioned in so many passages of Scripture. True, the devil attempts to
dai-ken this truth, and says: “Does the Pope uproot trees? does he
make them bear blossoms on their roots? does he sweep through the
air on a chariot drawn by steeds of fire? or has he even countless
treasures hidden in any place? all which things are distinctive of Anti-
chrisffl' Now it would be easy, by a mystical interpretation of Scripture,
to show how flimsy these objections of Satan are3 but it is by no means
necessary to try that way of answering. Ι, who am so much suspected
of heresy, maintain the obvious meaning of Scripture3 and I say: Every
person who publicly sets himself up against Christ is Antichrist.¹ Such
is the Pope —— not one single· Person, as for instance, the present
Pope — but all Popes since the endowment of the Church, all Car-
dinals and Bisliops, and all their accomplices. Antichrist is thus a mon-
strous composite personality.2 There may even have been saints amongst
the number, as, v. g. Gregory, who perhaps repented sincerely at the
end of his life. Such a thing is possible, but not an article of faith.3
Laymen too may be companions of Antichrist.4 — What are the outward
and visible signs of Antichrist? This is a point upon which Wyclif
likes to dwell, and he mentions it in many of his works. The first sign
is as follows: Christ was the humblest, the poorest, the most obedient
of men. Who can say that of the Pope?5 Does he not take most cruel
revenge upon his enemies? Does he not bring all his deeds, all his
thoughts to bear upon the acquisition of worldly power and inssuence?
And does he obediently follow God's law as set down in Scripture? As
he always does exactly the reverse, he is Antichrist more than all

sensu Scripture probabiliter dicere sensum nostrum, intendendo illi grammatice vul-
gari quam habet Johannes, dicens quod Antichristi facti sunt multi, sic videlicet
quod quelibet persona que est contra Christum . . . dicitur Antichristus. p. 107.
² Papa est patulus Antichristus . . . non solum illa simplex persona que plus stabilit
plures leges contrarias legi Christi, sed multitudo paparum a tempore dotacionis . . .
Illa enim est Antichristi persona composita monstruosa . . . 3 Verumtamen
ista accepto tamquam probabile citra fidem. 4 Recipiendo iniurias sibi factas.

Deo et legi sue obedientissimus . . .
