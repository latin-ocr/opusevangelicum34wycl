INTRODUCTION.> XXIII

priests are to ssee to the mountains, that is, hold to Christ and His holy
doctrine. Temporal lords must stand aloof from Antichrist‚ and the
people must not suffer him to rob thern. Should those three classes act
in unity, the contrivances of Antichrist can be rejected and thrown away,
his adherents will be seen to have nothing of Holy Writ in their favour;
it will no longer be believed that a man is Christ's Vicar upon earth
because the majority of the Cardinals have chosen him: and all other
heretical inventions of the sort will be rooted out.

“Woe to those with child, and to those who give suck in those
days!’' “Pray that the persecution begin not on the Sabbath, nor in
winter.'' Persecution is in our days caused by the recently established
sects, which prevent us from becoming true disciples of Christ.

“There will then be great tribulation . . . and were not the days
thereos shortened‚ no man would be saved.³' We may suppose that
these days will end with the Schism, but the desolation will endure even
to the end. Now, when the Pope's indulgences and dispensations are more
valued than ever, the tribulation is greatest. Can matters be worse indeed
than when the Pope commands Christians to slay their brethren for his
own private advantage?¹

“If 111611 men say 111110 you, cSee, the Christ is here, or there,’
believe it not, for false Christs will arise,>³ &c. Wyclif naturally does
not let this verse pass without an allusion to the events of his time.
Many popes come and say, I am Christ. But when they bring forth their
indulgences‚ privileges and dispensations‚ believe them not. God suffers
the Sects; every thing has its time, as the saying goes. They serve to
purify the righteous‚ and, like the present schism, are not without cause;
for the schism shows the weakness of Antichrist7 the unsure ground on
which he stands, and the small amount of authority that he possesses.

The rest of these commentaries follow the same lines. We may
quote a few of the most striking passages. The faithful should be advised
not to apply for indulgences either at Avignon or in Rome. God‚ the
Ruler of the Universe, cannot be confined in so small a spot, and grants
His graces to men in every part of the world. -— We must bear in
mind the examples of the Saints, and how they abhorred such heretics
