XIV INTRODUCTION.

Roman Curia.¹ The Pope does not choose preachers, but mighty men
of war; not poor priests who follow Christ, but sons of great lords, and
Royal clerks, in order to win thern over to their side. But the monks
too strive to draw men into their sects, and to withdraw them from
imitating Christ, saying that their sect is better than His.

“Woe unto you, you blind guides, who say: Whoso swears by
the temple, it is nothing; but whoso swears by the gold in the temple,
he is a debtor.³' As in the days of the old Covenant, so now, these
words aim at those among the clergy who are possessed by greed and
cupidity. What has once been given to them, they call a thing sanctified,
and to take it from the so-called Church is the most awful sacrilege.
Thus lands may be given to the Church, but never taken from it; and
thus temporal possessions are accumulated even to rottenness;2 for this
accumulation causes wars to be made and conquests to ensue. Even
to rottenness also of those priests who possess the Church lands. All that
must be taken away, even as the temple in Jerusalem was robbed and
despoiled. Church property is not needed, nor are the new laws of the
so-called Church required, nor is the hierarchy a necessary thing. Were
the Pope and all his Cardinals to die or be deposed, the Church would
be better, not worse off than now.3 What are the Bishop's duties? To
give confirmation, to consecrate the holy oils, and to ordain priests. That
may be done by every true priest. Christ Himself received no such
unction.4

“Woe unto you, who make a duty of the slightest things, and neglect
the weightiest: justice, mercy and faith.³³ Such is the conduct of our
parish priests, who care more for their tithes than for the things of
God. From the Pope downwards, all, even to the lowest clerk, think
more of their income than of the souls of their congregation.5 That is
