harm done by these new sects is incalculable. They assert that their
members go to Heaven without passing through Purgatory.

“Woe unto you who devour widow's housesl³³ The religious
Orders in our time are guilty of this. The monks of to-day are like
the lascivious elders who lusted aster the chaste Susanna. Covered by
a false seeming of holiness, our priests have criminal relations with
women, especially with such as are separated from their husbands. The
custom for women to keep a consessor in their husbands' absence has
almost passed into a rule. And what shall we say of the widows and
nuns whom such confessors lead astray? Thither tend all those pro-
tracted conversations with servants and maids during Mass, and the in-
cense burnt in women's apartments, as if there was a portion of the
Deity hiclden therein, and those brotherly gifts, or rather love-tokens,
which they exchange with women.1 — This is very like the portrait of
the monk Hubert, taken from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.2

Of what use can the letters of fraternity — a heretical contri-
vance —- and the prayers of such men be to any one? Those sects are
of the devil. As he beguiled Eve of old, so they now beguile gentle-
folk of both sexes; the Pope upholds them, and they stand up for him.
And for that very reason they are against men following the Order of
Christ: their Orders would soon be known to have no foundation in
God's law; they have crept in by a side door, like thieves and robbers,
as Scripture sayS. The endowed Orders and the begging friars are both
in the same category. They both try to get the possessions of the laity:
instead of living in marriage, according to the rule of Christ’s Order,
they lock themselves up in the monasteries of a sect which is not based
on Scripture; and, like the Mendicant Friars, they sin with widows. All
this because the Order of Christ is made of no account, and the com-
mands of Antichrist are obeyed by all.

“Woe unto you who compass sea and land to make one proselyte,
and when ye have him, ye make him a child of hell twice as wicked
as yourselvesl” Such are the Cardinals and Bishops instituted by the
