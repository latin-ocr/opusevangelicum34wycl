INTRODUCTION. XIX

“When ye see the abomination of desolation (let him who readeth
mark it well).³² This text, says Wyclif, may be rendered somewhat
obscure by Satan's cunning, yet its meaning can be found out, since
Christ Himself commands us to find it. Here an interpretation is necesssary,
and a good interpretation has as much value as a prophecy.¹ None of
the commentators on this Gospel has caught* the true meaning of the
text; yet there can be no doubt that by the abomination of desolation
Christ means the Pope‚2 because he is the source of all evil. He is the
abomination of desolation (an abstract quality), because, inveterate in evil,
he has become hardened even to fiendish perversity. This abomination
of desolation may be known by many visible signs.3 He sits in the holy
place; i. e., he arrogates supreme authority to himself, saying, not only
that he can do all that Christ did, but that he can do what Christ could
not,· for He never could have led such a life.4 But that is mere pride,
and the highest degree of depravity. Wyclif then proceeds to enumerate
the outward signs by which Antichrist may be known. They are eight,
and all show the Pope in the strongest contrast to Christ.⁵

1. Christ was most humble and extremely poor. The Pope is the
most arrogant of men, and most greedy of power⁰

2. Christ was a help (allevians) to the Church; the Pope, both in
himself and in his adherents‚ is its greatest burden.

3. Christ eschewed all worldly possesions3 the Pope is no longer
a shepherd, but, like a blind mole, he teaches us to love things temporal,
both by his own example and that of others.

4. Christ journeyed on foot throughout the land, relieving the
oppressed, and healing the siek; the Pope, like another cosroes, resides
in a superb palace, built with the sweat of poor men's brows -— and
he oppresses the poor.

5. Christ gave all grace freely to men; the Pope sells every
spiritual comfort, and thus proves himself guilty of simony.
