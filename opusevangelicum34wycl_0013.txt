INTRODUCTloN. IX

was always a model of poverty in His life; the Pope thinks it glorious
to be the richest man in the world. Christ was meekness itself, the
Pope is most arrogant, cruel and revengeful;· not having all the power
he desires, he scatters anathemas abroad, and grants indulgences to all
such as revenge him on his enemy the anti-pope: of which the Crusade
is a recent proof. Can a greater contrast be conceived than that be-
ween Christ and the Pope? Christ gives his life for his enemies; the
Pope sacrifices the lives of many Christians‚ in order to keep that
temporal power of which the possession is against God⁷s law!

Whereas Christ forbids us most severely to set up any laws in
opposition to His, the Pope promulgates many anti-scriptural edicts, and
punishes those who disobey them more than the transgressors of God's
commandments; as, for instance, in his behaviour to the cardinals.1 If
Christ carne to save souls, and the Pope continually destroys them, is
he not Antichrist?

Christ sent His disciples out into the world. Antichrist does the
reverse; he lives in superb palaces, built with the money of the poor,
or flees by night from place to place like a thies, not daring to raise
his head because of his enemies, He gives his disciples comfortable
dwellings in the Patrimony of the Crucified; he does not send forth his
monks, but locks them up, lest they should preach. Each of them, like
another Cosroes‚ lives in his castle‚ the one in Avignon‚ the other in
Rome; neither of them caring about the Gospel. Is that to follow Christ?

Jesus hates all worldly power; Antichrist sets himself above any,
and by the aid of his accomplices‚ the monks of the various Orders, he
rules over all countries.

Christ obeyed the Emperor, and had no desire of secular dominion‚
either sor Himself or sor His disciples; He was no burden to the secular
lords, nor to their vassals: in all this the Pope does the contrary. He
has stolen not less than one half of the Roman Empire. Neither Christ
nor His disciples would have accepted such power3 yet the Pope does
all to increase the inssuence of the clergy and decrease that of the laity.

1Papa autem dicitur condere multas leges que distrahunt a noticia Iegis
Christi et sapiunt crudelitatem multiplicem personarum ut periti eliciunt de penis
repugnancium cardinalium (the text should run thus, not cardinalibus) plus puni-
torum . . . See GregoroviuS, Gesch. d. stadt Rom im Mittelalter Vl, 518.
