amend bad priests, whom he compares with wild beasts. They are very
numerous, for many are priests only in name, not in deed: these should
not receive the respect due to members of the clergy. It is of that part
of the priesthood that Antichrist will come.¹ By what characters are bad
priests to be recognized? The best test is the life and the doctrines
of Christ, neither of which is followed by the clergy of our times.
In the times of Christ, the high priests, scribes and Pharisees were
the worst: so are the PopeS, doctors and monks in our days. To-day
we have as much right as then to say of the prelates: “Do whatsoever
they tell you, but do not according to their deeds; for they say, and
do not.'³ They do not seek after salvation, but are greedy of honours

1 Oportet Antichristum descendere de linea sacerdotis. De Antichr. p. 6.
2 Tales iudices non querunt propter salutem sed propter mundanum fastum aut

lucrum temporalium . . . 3 Et sic dicunt implicite quod mendacium fratris apud
Sarum de duce lancastrie fuit evangelium, p. 7. 4 Laici debent de vita et
operibus presbyteri iudicare, p. 8. 5 Videtur istum sanctum innuere quod grave

est et infundabile presbyterum audire confessiones populi modo quo Latini utuntur . . .
θ Sicut autem a ternpore Christi usque ad hunc Jeronymum et sanctos doctores alios
sine tali confessione sancti ad patriam spissius volaverunt, sic post iniunctam istam

confessionem ab Innocencio spissius ad tartara descenderunt . . . Dirumpamus vin—
