INTRoDUcTioN. V

repeatedly says that in his opinion the Papacy must infallibly be shat-
tered one day.

In the two latter books, still more than in the former, Wyclif is
taken up by the notion that the Pope is identical with Antichrist, and
indeed he at first gave them the title “De Antichristo''.

Works with this title, as is well known, appeared almost as
soon as Christianity itself. Most of them belong to the Millenarian type,
and were most popular in the times of that heresy. Wyclif's doctrine
cannot be said to resemble it in the least. He mentions indeed, not
without respect, the names of Joachim de Floris,¹ but he rejects with
contempt all prophecies as to the approaching end of the world, and
blames the folly of those who engage in such fruitless enquiries. The time
of the Day of Judgment is a point on which God has chosen to leave
115 111 ignorance. He also puts but little saith in prophets and prophecies
since the Christian era, and rebukes the Abbot Joachim with having
given way to such 1111631111655.2 It is well that we are ignorant of such
matters, because we are thus excited to greater vigilance. Wyclif's mind
was by far too much taken up with the Scriptures to allow himself to
go beyond their sure foundation. He does not even conceive Antichrist
as a fixed personality; a contemporary of the Emperor Frederick II
called Pope Innocent IV by that name; the Bohemian ΜίΙίοΖ,3 111 3 public
discourse, called the Emperor Charles IV Antichrist: Wyclif avoids this,
and stands quite aloof from the fanciful notions attached to this word
by the vulgar, and which were prevalent at that times*

1 He names him as a victim of Innocent lll’s intolerance: contra abbatem
Joachim et alios irreligiose processit (De Eucharistia. pag. 278). 2 Ex fide
sumus certissimi quod tempore suo est dies indicii; sed quando et quam distanter
ab hoc instanti, oportet nos secundum doctrinam evangelii ignorare. Unde stulti et
curiosi qui circa hoc se vane sollicitant sunt racionabiliter increpandi. In cuius sig-
num Deus cecavit eorum noticiam, ut patet de abbate Joachim et aliis, qui circa
istam materiam inaniter intromittunt. Salubris est enim hec nesciencia commixta cum
hac fidei noticia, ut fideles instancius vigilarent . . . . Serm. Ι, 85. Et hoc ignorarunt
calculatores presumptuosi‚ ut abbas Joachim et ceteri qui prophetantes de die
iudicii turpiter defecerunt . . . . 3 Anonymi de Innocentio IV P. M. Antichristo
